<h1>
	About Me
</h1>
<p><i>I am a full stack web developer. So far I have learned HTML5, CSS3, Javascript5 and Emmascript7. </p><p>So far I am working on a few projects, and hope to show you them soon!</i></p><br>
<p> I started coding when my dad interduced me to the Zero to Mastery school. My learning to be a web developer has been</p> <p>both fun and challenging. I have 
been facing many problems and had to work hard to find the solution. If I didn't find out what the problem was,</p><p> I asked for help, and in that way learned more.  I enjoy coding and all the challenge that comes with it.<p> I am hoping to start working on a project once I finish this </p><p>website. I always feel the thrill of creating something new when I code. I look forward to keep coding and learning new things. </p> 
<p class="thrill">Yours,
 Maayan Wietchner</p>
